Search in sorted rotated sorted array
================

### Task
Search for element in rotated sorted array with time complexity \(O(log(n))\).
More than 3 edge and normal cases tested.

### Choices and reasoning

-  Binary search to search for index before rotation. Time complexity \(O(log(n))\),
space complexity \(O(1\).
- Binary search, rotating the index. Time complexity \(O(log(n))\), space complexity \(O(1\).
- More than 3 edge and normal cases tested.


### Complexity

- Big O, time complexity: \(O(log(n))\).

- Big O, space complexity: \(O(1)\)
