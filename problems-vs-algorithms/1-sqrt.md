Sqrt
================

### Task
Calculate integer square root.

### Choices and reasoning

In order to satisfy the constrains I used:

- Binary search over possible roots.
- More than 3 edge and normal cases tested.

### Complexity

- Big O, time complexity: \(O(log(n))\).

- Big O, space complexity: \(O(1)\), no extra objects created.
