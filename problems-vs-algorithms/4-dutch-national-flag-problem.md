Dutch National Flag Problem
================

### Task
Given an input array consisting on only 0, 1, and 2, sort the array in a single traversal

### Choices and reasoning

- Create three indices: current index, index of last a 0 to the right, last index of a 2 to the left.
- Iterate current index and swapping 0 to start of the array and 2 to the end of the array. Swaps occur in place. Time complexity \(O(n\), space complexity \(O(1\).
- More than 3 edge and normal cases tested.

### Complexity

- Big O, time complexity: \(O(n\).

- Big O, space complexity: \(O(1\).
