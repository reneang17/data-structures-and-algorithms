Max and Min in a Unsorted Array
================

### Task

Find the smallest and largest integer from a list of unsorted integers. The code should run in O(n) time. Do not use Python's inbuilt functions to find min and max.


### Choices and reasoning

- Single iterating comparing at each step the max/min. Time complexity \(O(n\), space
complexity \(O(1\).

### Complexity

- Big O, time complexity: \(O(n\)

- Big O, space complexity: \(O(1\).
