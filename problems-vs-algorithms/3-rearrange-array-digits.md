Rearrenge digits
================

### Task
Rearrange digits of unsorted array into two numbers, which yield the larges possible number.

### Choices and reasoning

In order to satisfy the constrains I used:

- Sort using merge sort. Time complexity  \(O(n * log(n))\), space complexity  \(O(n\).
- Reverse array. Time  \(O(n\), space  \(O(n\)
- Empty array into the two numbers. Time  \(O(n\), space  \(O(1\).
- More than 3 edge and normal cases tested.

### Complexity

- Big O, time complexity: \(O(n * log(n))\).

- Big O, space complexity: \(O(n\).
