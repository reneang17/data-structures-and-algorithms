# Data Structure and Algorithms 

Here you could find my notes and exercises on my Nanodegree on Data Structures and algorithms. 
Each relevant data structure and algirhtms include a unit test as well as time/space complexity analysis.

### Data Structures 

You'll find some implementation from scratch and uses of the following:

- Linked list
- Binary tree
- Red black tree
- Trie
- Quees and Stack
- Heap tree

### Algorithsm (from scrath)

- Quicksort
- Binary search
- Mergesort
- Quickselect
- Binary search
- Heapsort
